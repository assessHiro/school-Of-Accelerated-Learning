##  TASK 1 - Seating Arrangement

![Tables](/tables.png)

The complete seating arrangement is divided into 3 sections i.e S1, S2 and S3.

We have to design a seating arrangement for families. Each family comprises of exactly "4" members
in it.

### Technical Assignment

- You need to create a function which accepts 2 parameters: 1) No. of rows ("r" -> Integer) 2) Blocked
seats (For example = [ a1, a3, b2, c1, c6 ,...])
- While making the arrangement, you have to take this into consideration that all 4 members can seat in multiple rows but adjacent to each other.
- Such cases like ['a1','b1','c1','d1'], ['e1','f1','g1','h1'], ['g1','h1','i1','j1'], etc are not possible.
- Valid cases - ['a1', 'b1', 'c1', 'a2'] (2nd row), ['a1','b1','c1','b2'], ['a1','b1','c1', 'c2'] , ['d1', 'e1','f1','g1']

### Expected :

- You need to find the maximum number of families that can get accommodated in the theater.
- Write down the pseudo code/logic how you would solve this
- Provide a working solution in the language of your choice to achieve this.


## TASK 2 - Fastest Bulls

Ever seen a bull race? There are 25 bulls among which you need to find out the fastest 3 bulls.
You can conduct race among at most 5 to find out their relative speed.
At no point you can find out the actual speed of the Bull in a race. 

Find out how many races are required to get the top 3 fastest Bulls. 

### Expected :

- You need to find the minimum number of races that can be done to get the fastest 3 bulls.
- Write down the pseudo code/logic how you would solve this
- Provide a working solution in the language of your choice to achieve this.


## TASK 3 - Create a Student attendance tracker

School ABC has moved their classes online and wants to track the attendance of the learners attending the lectures online.
